## Data

"The catalog consists of two subcatalogs: the DR16Q superset containing 1,440,615 observations targeted as quasars, and the quasar-only set containing 750,414 quasars.
[...]
We include automated pipeline redshifts for all quasars observed as part of SDSS-III/IV and confident visual inspection redshifts for 320,161 quasars [probably objects not spectra].
[...]
DR16Q includes homogeneous redshifts derived using principal component analysis, including six separate emission line PCA redshifts." (Lyke et al., 2020)
